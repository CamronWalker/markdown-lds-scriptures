__Summary__



---

###### 1
WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
###### 2
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
###### 3
The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
###### 4
Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
###### 5
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
###### 6
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
