1 O GOD, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
###### 2
2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
###### 3
3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
###### 4
4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
###### 5
5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
###### 6
6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
###### 7
7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
###### 8
8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
###### 9
9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
###### 10
10 Who will bring me into the strong city?  who will lead me into Edom?
