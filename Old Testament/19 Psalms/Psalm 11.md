###### 3
3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
###### 4
4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
###### 5
5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
