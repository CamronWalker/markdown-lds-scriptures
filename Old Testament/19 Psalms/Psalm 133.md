>[!example] Chapter Summary
>
###### 1
BEHOLD, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
###### 2
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
###### 3
As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
