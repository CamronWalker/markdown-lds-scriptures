__Summary__



---

###### 1
THE fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.  They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
###### 2
The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.
###### 3
They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
###### 4
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?  who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
###### 5
There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.
###### 6
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.
###### 7
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!  when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
