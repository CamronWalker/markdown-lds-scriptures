>[!example] Chapter Summary
>
###### 1
1 THE fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.  Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
###### 2
2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
###### 3
3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
###### 4
4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?  who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
###### 5
5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
###### 6
6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!  When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
