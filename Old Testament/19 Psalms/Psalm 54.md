###### 1
SAVE me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
###### 2
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
###### 3
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them.  Selah.
###### 4
Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
###### 5
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
###### 6
I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.
###### 7
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
