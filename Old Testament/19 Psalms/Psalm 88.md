>[!example] Chapter Summary

###### 1
1 O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
###### 2
2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
###### 3
3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
###### 4
4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:
###### 5
5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
###### 6
6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
###### 7
7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves.  Selah.
###### 8
8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
###### 9
9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
###### 10
10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?  shall the dead arise and praise thee?  Selah.
###### 11
11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?  or thy faithfulness in destruction?
###### 12
12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?  and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
###### 13
13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
###### 14
14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul?  why hidest thou thy face from me?
###### 15
15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
###### 16
16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
###### 17
17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
###### 18
18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
